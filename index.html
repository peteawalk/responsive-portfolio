            My name is Peter and I would love to help <em>you</em> with your next web based creation. I am passionate
            about designing web applications to solve problems. My toolset includes: HTML5, CSS, Javascript, React,
            Node.JS, and more. If you have a problem that needs solving, need a simple website or even a community to
            reach all your customers, we can work to get it built and solve your problem. Check out my github repo if
            you are interested in looking at code. You can also reach out to me if you are interested in working
            together on something.
        </p>
