                My name is Peter and I would love to help <em>you</em> with your next web based creation. I am
                passionate
                about designing web applications to solve problems. My toolset includes: HTML5, CSS, Javascript, React,
                Node.JS, and more. If you have a problem that needs solving, need a simple website or even a community
                to
                reach all your customers, we can work to get it built and solve your problem. Check out my github repo
                if
                you are interested in looking at code. You can also reach out to me if you are interested in working
                together on something.
            </p>
