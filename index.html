                My name is Peter and I would love to help <em>you</em> with your next web based creation. I am
                passionate about designing web applications to solve problems. My toolset includes: HTML5, CSS, Javascript, React,
                Node.JS, and more. If you have a problem that needs solving, need a simple website or even a community
                to reach all your customers, we can work to get it built and solve your problem. Check out <strong><a href="https://github.com/peteawalk/">my github repo</a></strong>
                if you are interested in looking at code or would like to see more examples.
            </p>
