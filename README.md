# My Portfolio!
### Tech used: HTML, CSS and jQuery 
#### The latest update is responsive and a one page design. I bought my domain name from google domains and use netlify (free hosting). Definitely check them out - [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for hosting your site. It was super easy to get set-up and my github repo pushes automagically there.
